# Yash Bansal – Personal Portfolio 🌐

Welcome to my **Portfolio Repository**! This project contains the source code for my personal portfolio website built using **React and Vite**. It showcases my skills, projects, experience, and contact information.

🚀 A portfolio is a collection of work samples that highlights your skills, qualifications, training, and experiences — giving insight into your professional journey and personality. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
